      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This is a very classic French soufflé made by folding Mornay sauce into
        whipped egg whites for that golden, fluffy rise. (Mornay sauce is simply
        béchamel sauce with cheese melted through it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes this recipe different from most soufflés is that I use almost
        twice the usual amount of Mornay sauce. It gives the soufflé a real
        cheese flavour (rarer than you’d think!) and a luxuriously custardy,
        cloud-like centre that is truly restaurant quality – the standard the
        chefs I worked for expected of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bit of cream of tartar helps the soufflé stay stable without losing
        its light texture. We didn’t use it in restaurants, but I recommend it
        for home cooking as a little safety net.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve lost count on how many times I’ve tested this. Probably over 30 by
        now. But this didn’t affect my desire to show you how to make it so
        let’s get started!
      </p>
    </ul>
    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Milk, full fat –</h2>
          <p>
            Just plain cow milk. Low fat works as well. Do not substitute with
            non-dairy milk.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Unsalted butter –</h2>
          <p>
            For making the roux (the base of the Mornay sauce). If you only have
            salted, reduce the added salt.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Plain flour (all-purpose flour) –</h2>
          <p>
            Thickens the béchamel and stabilises the whipped eggs so it stays
            aerated and fluffy once baked. Make sure to cook it for a couple of
            minutes with the butter so you don’t end up with a raw flour taste.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Egg –</h2>
          <p>
            We use the yolks to enrich the sauce. And the whites are the secret
            to that beautiful lift! Separate the eggs when fridge cold – it’s
            easier – then let them come to room temperature before you start the
            recipe. Bonus point: you’ll have an extra yolk to use for one of
            these recipes!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Gruyère cheese –</h2>
          <p>
            Classic choice for cheese soufflé! With excellent melting qualities,
            Gruyère gives beautiful flavour without being overpowering. Comté is
            the closest match but can be a bit pricey here in Australia, feel
            free to use it if it’s affordable where you are. Swiss cheese /
            Emmental would be my next choice. Otherwise use your favourite
            melting cheese like Cheddar (mild ones), Monterey Jack, Colby or
            Tasty.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Cream of tartar –</h2>
          <p>
            Helps stabilise the beaten egg whites so they stay fluffy and don’t
            weep. We use the minimum amount here because using more compromises
            the texture (I tested). Using it also allows you to get more time to
            fold, fill, and bake your soufflé without losing volume. If you
            don’t have any, no worries, your soufflé will still rise
            beautifully, it just won’t stay puffed up quite as long.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Salt –</h2>
          <p>
            Cooking salt / Kosher salt, just enough to bring out the cheese
            flavour. Remember, cheeses can vary in saltiness, so taste your
            Mornay sauce before adding more.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>White pepper –</h2>
          <p>
            Used instead of black pepper so you don’t get little black specks
            showing through your beautiful golden soufflé. It gives a gentle
            warmth and mild spice. But if you don’t mind the look, black pepper
            works fine too!.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Preheat the oven – Preheat to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan). The oven
            needs to be really hot before you start, that first burst of heat
            helps the soufflé rise tall. If the oven isn’t hot enough, the
            soufflé won’t lift properly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prepare the ramekins – Brush the inside of 4 (325 ml / 1 1/3 cup)
            ramekins well with melted butter using a pastry brush, then place
            them on a baking tray. (There is a brushing upwards technique often
            used for soufflés but that’s only useful when the soufflé mixture
            goes in cold. Ours is warm, so no need for that trick, yes, I’ve
            tested it! It works great for cold mixtures like chocolate soufflés.
            Coming soon? Maybe!!!)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>
        <h3>Make Mornay sauce (cheese sauce)</h3>
        <p>
          Mornay sauce is simply béchamel sauce enriched with egg yolks and
          cheese. It’s not difficult to make at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heat the milk – Pour the milk into a small saucepan and place it over
          medium heat. Warm it until you see steam rising, but don’t let it
          boil. Set it aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make the roux – While the milk warms, melt the butter in a large
          saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk gently. It will
          look thick and pasty at first, like wet sand. Keep whisking for about
          2 minutes until it becomes smooth and shiny. Make sure to scrape into
          the corners of the pan and don’t let it brown. If it’s cooking too
          fast, lower the heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make Béchamel – Slowly add one-third of the hot milk to the roux while
          whisking quickly. It will thicken right away. Then add half of the
          remaining milk, whisk until smooth, and finally add the rest along
          with the salt and pepper. Keep whisking for about a minute until the
          sauce is thick, smooth, and lump-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check the thickness – When you drag a spatula through the middle of
          the sauce, it should leave a clear path that holds its shape for a
          moment before slowly closing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the yolks – Turn off the heat and whisk in the egg yolks one by
          one. They won’t cook, they will just blend in to make the sauce
          richer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add cheese and turn it into a Mornay sauce – Turn the heat back to
          medium and whisk in the grated Gruyère until melted and smooth. Scrape
          down the sides, cover with a lid, and set aside. Congratulations –
          you’ve just made a Mornay sauce!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Folding in the Egg Whites and Baking</h3>

        <p>
          Beat the egg whites – Put the egg whites and cream of tartar in a
          large bowl. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk
          attachment, start beating on medium speed for about 2 minutes until
          soft peaks form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finish the egg whites – Increase the speed to high and beat for
          another 30 seconds until firm peaks form (see photo above). Starting
          slowly helps the whites build a stable structure. If you rush, they’ll
          turn foamy and collapse later, I’ve learned that the hard way!
        </p>
        <p>
          Fold gently – Using a hand whisk, give the Mornay a quick whisk to
          make it smooth again. Add a quarter of the beaten egg whites and whisk
          it in to loosen the Mornay sauce. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently
          fold in one-third of the remaining whites. Use slow, sweeping motions
          from the bottom of the bowl, you want to keep as much air as possible.
          (See video at 2.15 minutes). Rough folding = flat soufflé.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finish the mixture – Repeat folding two more times until all the egg
          whites are just combined. Don’t worry about a few white streaks,
          they’ll blend in later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fill the ramekins – Use a ladle or large spoon to fill the ramekins to
          about 1 cm / 0.4″ below the rim. Smooth the tops with the back of a
          spoon dipped in water. ⚠️ Don’t overfill or they’ll overflow. And if
          you don’t fill enough, they won’t rise above the rim impressively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clean the rims – Run your thumb around the inside rim of each ramekin
          to clean it, this gives the soufflé a clean edge to rise against.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bake – Place the ramekins on a tray and bake for 20 minutes until tall
          and golden, but it jiggles if you give the ramekin a gentle shake. Do
          not open the oven door, the sudden drop in heat will make them sink.
          So no peeking! 🫣
        </p>
        <p>
          Serve immediately – Once out of the oven, serve right away. Soufflés
          rise beautifully but fall fast, that’s just how they are! So make sure
          everyone’s ready at the table to enjoy the moment.
