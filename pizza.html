        Thursday Night Pizza's Halloween spider web pizza
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to make something festive (but not this festive) for
        Halloween dinner, then you've come to the right place. Not only is this
        recipe super easy to make, but it's also delicious and kid-friendly.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <ul>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <li>
        <p>4 sticks whole-milk string cheese</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>12 large pitted black olives</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          1 (14- to 16-ounce) ball pizza dough (I recommend my overnight recipe,
          but you can also use a ball of your favorite store-bought dough)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          ⅔ to ¾ cup Super-Easy Marinara Sauce (or your favorite store-bought
          pizza sauce)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Steps -->
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Steps</h2></li>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 500°F (if using a baking sheet) or as high as it
        will go (if using a baking stone/steel; place the stone/steel in the
        oven before you start preheating).
      </p>
      <p>
        While the oven preheats, prep the spiderweb and spider toppings: Pull
        the string cheese into thin strips and set aside. Cut the olives in half
        lengthwise. Set 8 of the halves aside (these will be your spiders'
        bodies), and cut each of the remaining halves lengthwise into 4
        equal-size strips (these will be the spiders' legs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Stretch or roll out your dough to a 12- to 14-inch circle, then transfer
        it to a baking sheet/pizza pan or a lightly floured pizza peel (if using
        a baking stone/steel). Prick the dough all over with a fork (this will
        prevent crust bubbles from messing up your spiderweb design).
      </p>
      <p>
        Spread the sauce on top of the dough, leaving a ½-inch border all
        around.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transfer the sauced dough to the oven. Bake just until the crust looks
        dry and is light golden in color and the sauce is bubbling but not yet
        browned in spots, about 3 minutes on a stone/steel and 5 minutes on a
        baking sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remove the pizza from the oven. Working as quickly as you can, arrange
        the strips of string cheese on the pizza in the shape of a spider web
        (watch the video for a step-by-step tutorial), then assemble the spiders
        wherever you like across the web (each spider gets an olive-half body
        and 8 olive slice legs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Return the pizza to the oven and bake for another 3 to 5 minutes, until
        the cheese has just melted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remove the pizza from the oven. Let cool slightly, then slice and serve.
      </p>
