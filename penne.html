      <li><h2>Description</h2></li>
      <p>
        So, I am not sure that one line summary of today’s recipe will go
        anywhere beyond my little corner of the internet. But that is my
        articulate description of the greatness that is Penne all’Arrabbiata!
        Simple made interesting with a good kick of chilli and healthy dose of
        garlic. The Italians know a thing or two about making simple pastas
        great!
      </p>
      <p>
        By way of background, “Arrabbiata” means “angry” in Italian. So this
        pasta is said to be named as such in reference to its fiery nature!
      </p>
      <p>
        But fear not. Yes, this is a pasta that is meant to be spicy. But it’s
        fundamentally a great tomato pasta that you can make as spicy as you’d
        like. Or not. It’s easy to adjust – just make the sauce with less chilli
        to start with. Taste it during the simmer time. Add more if you’re
        feeling bold!
      </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Cayenne pepper –</h3>
          <p>
            The larger the chilli, the less spicy they are! So cayenne peppers
            are not super spicy. Though, I do like to keep the seeds in for an
            extra zing of spiciness (the seeds is where most of the spiciness
            is). Feel free to de-seed if you prefer, or just use dried chillis
            (see note above photo for why I use fresh and dried).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Dried red chillis –</h3>
          <p>
            Feel brave? Use Birds Eye or Thai chillies instead! They pack more
            spiciness than cayenne peppers.
          </p>
          <p>
            These have a warm earthiness that fresh chillis do not. Sauteing
            with garlic brings out the toasty flavour as well as the spiciness.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Pasta type –</h3>
          <p>
            Traditionally made with penne, though ziti is a direct replacement
            (it’s penne with a smooth surface). Though really, you can make this
            with any short or long pasta.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Canned crushed tomato –</h3>
          <p>
            To be authentic, use whole peeled tomatoes (canned) and mash them up
            with a fork. For convenience, I use crushed tomatoes!
          </p>
          <p>
            Sourness note: Not all canned tomatoes are created equal! Economical
            brands tend to be more sour. Take the edge off with ½ teaspoon of
            sugar.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Garlic –</h3>
          <p>
            3 cloves! Arrabiata sauce is meant to have a nice hit of garlic
            flavour.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Parmesan –</h3>
          <p>For serving.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Parsley –</h3>
          <p>For optional garnish.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Steps</h2></li>
      <p>
        Finely mince the cayenne pepper with the seeds in. (See note in the
        ingredients section about seeds and spiciness)
      </p>
      <p>
        Sauté garlic and chilli – Use a pot large enough to toss the pasta with
        the sauce. Heat the oil over medium heat, then stir the garlic for just
        10 seconds. Add cayenne and chilli flakes, then cook for 1 minute, or
        until garlic is light golden.
      </p>
      <p>How to make Penne all'arrabbiata (spicy tomato pasta)</p>
      <p>
        Simmer – Add tomato, salt and pepper. Rinse out the tomato cans with a
        bit of water and add that in too. Then simmer the sauce gently for 15
        minutes until it thickens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Save water for sauce – While the sauce is cooking, cook the pasta per
        packet directions in salted pasta cooking water. Just before draining,
        give the pot a big stir (to agitate the starch* in the pasta) then scoop
        out 1 cup of the water. Then drain the pasta.
      </p>
      <p>
        The starch in the pasta cooking water helps the pasta sauce thicken so
        it clings to the pasta better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Toss – Add the pasta into the sauce along with 1/2 cup of the pasta
        cooking water. Toss well (still on the stove) until the sauce coats the
        pasta and is no longer pooled in the base of the pot. Use extra pasta
        cooking water if needed, to loosen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Serve – Dinnertime! Divide between bowls and serve immediately with
        parmesan and parsley, if using.
